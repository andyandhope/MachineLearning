The first row is for customers whose actual churn value in the test set is 1.\n","As you can calculate, out of 40 customers, the churn value of 15 of them is 1.\n","Out of these 15 cases, the classifier correctly predicted 6 of them as 1, and 9 of them as 0.\n","\n","This means, for 6 customers, the actual churn value was 1 in test set and classifier also correctly predicted those as 1. However, while the actual label of 9 customers was 1, the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good. We can consider it as the error of the model for first row.\n","\n","What about the customers with churn value 0? Lets look at the second row.\n","It looks like there were 25 customers whom their churn value were 0.\n","\n","The classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about the confusion matrix is that it shows the model‚Äôs ability to correctly predict or separate the classes. In a specific case of the binary classifier, such as this example, we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.73      0.96      0.83        25\n","           1       0.86      0.40      0.55        15\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.75        40\n","   macro avg       0.79      0.68      0.69        40\n","weighted avg       0.78      0.75      0.72        40\n","\n"]}],"source":["print(classification_report(y_test, yhat))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<!-- @format -->\n","\n","Based on the count of each section, we can calculate precision and recall of each label:\n","\n","- **Precision** is a measure of the accuracy provided that a class label has been predicted.
